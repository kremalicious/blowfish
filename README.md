## Features

- show Ocean Token balances from a list of Ethereum account addresses
- show a total balance of all account balances
- convert those balances against multiple currencies
- re-fetches everything automatically every minute
- balances are fetched via etherscan.io API
- spot prices are fetched from coingecko.com API
- detects dark appearance setting and switches to dark theme automatically (macOS only)
- detects system accent color and uses it as primary color (macOS & Windows only)
- Touch Bar support (macOS only)
- detects system locale for number formatting
- currently highly optimized for macOS, your mileage on Windows or Linux may vary

## Download

You can download pre-built binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows from the [Releases page](https://github.com/kremalicious/blowfish/releases).

The binaries are not code-signed so opening them on macOS will result in a warning. To be able to get around this warning:

1. Right-click on the app icon, and choose _Open_
2. In the dialog, click _Open_

Alternatively, you can [build the app on your system](#build-packages).

## Development

The main app is a React app authored with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) in `src/renderer/` wrapped within an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) app defined in `src/main/`.

Clone, and run:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone git@github.com:kremalicious/blowfish.git
cd blowfish

# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app in dev mode
npm start
```

## Configuration

The app has a settings screen where you can add your account addresses.

When building the app yourself, you can configure more in the `src/config.js` file:

| Key                  | Description                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `conversions`        | Array defining the currencies the Ocean balance is converted to. Every currency listed here will appear in the ticker buttons. |
| `refreshInterval`    | Defines the interval prices and balances are refetched.                                                                        |
| `oceanTokenContract` | Contract address of the Ocean Token. You should not change this.                                                               |

## Build packages

```bash
npm run dist
```

Will build and package the app into platform specific packages for macOS, Windows & Linux.

On a Mac and Linux machine, packaging requires [`wine`](https://www.winehq.org) in your `PATH`. To install on macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew install wine
```

## Creating Releases

From a clean `master` branch, running any release task will do the following:

- bumps the project version
- creates a Git tag
- commits and pushes everything
- creates a GitHub release with commit messages as description
- adds freshly build binaries for macOS, Windows & Linux as assets to each GitHub release

You can execute the script using {major|minor|patch} as first argument to bump the version accordingly:

- To bump a patch version: `npm run release`
- To bump a minor version: `npm run release minor`
- To bump a major version: `npm run release major`

For the GitHub releases steps a GitHub personal access token, exported as `GITHUB_TOKEN` is required. [Setup](https://github.com/release-it/release-it#github-releases)
